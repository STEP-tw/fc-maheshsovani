<b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf) </b> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive 
family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species, <b> Abeliophyllum distichum </b>Nakai, endemic to Korea, where it is
endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not
yellow, flowers. 
        
It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are opposite,simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm
wide, pubescent both above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they
are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm 
diameter.

It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
